# Chatalone

This is my Final Year Project in my final year of Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science) with Honours in Nanyang Technological University which it was given a grade of A-.

This project was then suggested to be implemented as a start-up by my professor. 

# About Chatalone

Chatalone is a cross-platform anonymous chat application that does not require the use of internet-connectivity and mobile cellular. 

It utilizes Bluetooth BLE to connect to other mobile devices to create a Peer-to-peer mesh network for communication.

There are 3 different types of communication via Chatalone,
- Mesh Chat
- Chatrooms
- Private Chat

Mesh Chat: Users can talk to all nearby users within a radius. 

Chatrooms: Users can create chatrooms with an interesting title to chat with other users with similar interests.

Private Chat: Users can private message one another. They can also send images and voice recordings through private chat. 

Users can use Chatalone in various ways as they like:
- Asking nearby users for help via Mesh Chat.
- Asking local users for directions or reccomendations via Mesh Chat.
- Gossip anonymously in class.
- Talking to nearby users via Mesh Chat when you're alone at a bar/concert/event.
- Creating a chatroom to talk to others with similar interests.
- Event Organizers can create a chatroom to allow for anonymous Q&A or feedback.
- Lecturers/Teachers can create chatroom to let students answer questions anonymously.
- Shopping Malls/Places of Interests/Pubic Transport can create a chatroom for people to give suggestions/feedback/complaint.
- Military can use this application as a form of communication when there is no signal in the jungle. Additional set up is required to only allow communication to certain devices/personnel. 

# Anonymity

Users are not allowed to use their own photos as their profile photo. They are given a range of animal icons to select as their avatar.

Users are encouraged to not use their real name as their username. 
Users are allowed to change their username at any given time.

All messages are deleted upon exiting and launching the application. 

All messages are encoded before sending.
