# Chatalone

This is my Final Year Project in my final year of Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science) with Honours in Nanyang Technological University which it was given a grade of A-.

This project was then suggested to be implemented as a start-up by my professor. 

# About Chatalone

Chatalone is a cross-platform anonymous chat application that does not require the use of internet-connectivity and mobile cellular. 

It utilizes Bluetooth BLE to connect to other mobile devices to create a Peer-to-peer mesh network for communication.

There are 3 different types of communication via Chatalone,
- Mesh Chat
- Chatrooms
- Private Chat

Mesh Chat: Users can talk to all nearby users within a radius. 

Chatrooms: Users can create chatrooms with an interesting title to chat with other users with similar interests.

Private Chat: Users can private message one another. They can also send images and voice recordings through private chat. 

Users can use Chatalone in various ways as they like:
- Asking nearby users for help via Mesh Chat.
- Asking local users for directions or reccomendations via Mesh Chat.
- Gossip anonymously in class.
- Talking to nearby users via Mesh Chat when you're alone at a bar/concert/event.
- Creating a chatroom to talk to others with similar interests.
- Event Organizers can create a chatroom to allow for anonymous Q&A or feedback.
- Lecturers/Teachers can create chatroom to let students answer questions anonymously.
- Shopping Malls/Places of Interests/Pubic Transport can create a chatroom for people to give suggestions/feedback/complaint.
- Military can use this application as a form of communication when there is no signal in the jungle. Additional set up is required to only allow communication to certain devices/personnel.

Users are allowed to change their username at any given time.

All messages are deleted upon exiting and launching the application.
